# Ultra task:

### You have a folder with following structure:

      foo
      ├── Name-0.txt
      ├── NaMe-0 0.txt
      └── bar
          ├── Name 1.txt
          ├── Name 1 1.txt
          └── NAME 1 3.txt

Please suggest ways how would you replace spaces by underscore (' ' -> '\_') and replace all uppercase letters by lower case?
Please keep in mind that there may be 100+ folders.
Please suggest ways for both - Windows and linux OS.
